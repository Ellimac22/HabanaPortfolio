    Internet and the World Wide Web
  </h1>
  <p>
    Many people use the terms <strong style="color: tomato">Internet</strong> and <strong style="color: tomato">World Wide Web</strong> interchangeably,
<br>but in fact, the two terms are not synonymous. The Internet and the Web are two
<br>separated but related things.
<br>
<br>
        The <strong style="color: tomato">Internet</strong> is a massive network of networks, a networking infrastracture. It
    <br>connects millions of computers together globally, forming a network in which 
    <br>any computer can communicate with other computers as long as they are both
    <br>connected to the internet. Information can travel via internet via a variety of
    <br>languages called <em>"Protocols".</em>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    The <strong style="color: tomato">World Wide Web</strong> or simply <em>"Web"</em>, is a way of accessing information over
    <br> the medium of the internet. It is an information-sharing model that is built on top
    <br>of the internet. The Web uses the <strong style="color:tomato">HTTP protocol</strong>, only one of the languages
    <br>spoken over the internet, to transmit data.
